# Birdy-Birdy
Birdy Birdy is a multipurpose Discord bot. This is the Github repository for the code that I use. It uses Javascript and libraries including discord.js, ytdl-core, node-ytsr, etc. The bot is currently hosted using repl.it so it can be online even when I'm not on my laptop. Here is a link to invite Birdy: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=756148630578135182&scope=bot&permissions=2146958591
